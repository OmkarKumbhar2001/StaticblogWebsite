        <h2>Few Hours in the Library</h2>
        <p>It was One of those Sunday mornings which I absolutely Hate. After slogging whole week including the
          Saturday. The early Sunday morning I had to visit the library in order to return the previous book and get a
          new one. On any other days I might not be this skeptical but today was different. Over the years, the sole
          purpose of Sunday mornings is to sleep and rejuvenate yourself for upcoming tedious week. But having to
          perform a task so petty such as Returning the book to the library seems like a mountain to climb. Irrespective
          of whatever age you might be, Sundays are meant to chill! Nevertheless I had to wake up(rather compel myself
          to wake up) get dressed and go to the library.
          I did what I to, got dressed in a navy blue-yellow varsity. Donned the Chuck taylor and left the library.
          Showed the ID, got in and then ran my way towards the Novel section.

          Today I had decided I'll take home something different than my usual reading taste, something that is praised
          by many but seldomly read by any(one). Yeah that means "A Classic". I trudged myself from shelf to shelf. From
          Shakespeare to Shaw, From Woodhouse to Tennyson. Finally settled on the Dickens shelf where I stumbled on a
          book called "Tale of two cities" which told the stories of two great European towns. London and Paris.

          I exchanged the book and quickly came towards the moped. Then I saw the sunlight had a different shade all
          together and my sneaks were shimmering in it. So HELL YEAH!! Took a picture of them to bless my overly
          aesthetics obsessed soul

          That's it for today folks hope you liked this arduous effort of mine to tell you my Hardships(I sound like a
          15 year old kid, but I don't mind really)

        <h2>FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h2>
        <p>1. Introduction: 
          Hello everyone this is Abhishek and we're today going to talk about an exceptionally beautiful Anime series called FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Power-packed with Viable dialogues, equally enthralling storyline and the classic Manga touch is the Series FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood (Acronymed as FMAB). 
          FMAB is Japanese anime television series adapted from the original Fullmetal Alchemist manga series by Hiromu Arakawa Produced by Bones studio , the series is directed by Yasuhiro Irie  written by Hiroshi  Ōnogi and composed by Akira Senju. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime television series based on the manga, with the first being 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist. Unlike the previous adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful adaptation that directly follows the entire storyline of the original manga. The series ran for 64 episodes on MBS-TBS from April 2009 to July 2010. 
          2.Ratings: 
          Rated 9.1/10 on IMDb, 9.2/10 on MAL(My anime list) and 100% on Rotten tomatoes. It doesn't fail to impress the viewers
          3. Anime synopsis: 
          Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric search for the Philsopher's Stone, hoping to restore their bodies, which were lost when they attempted to use their alchemy skills to resurrect their deceased mother. Edward, who lost only limbs, joins the State Military, which gives him the freedom to continue the search as he tries to restore his brother, whose soul is tethered to earth by a suit of armor. However, Edward and Alphonse are not the only ones seeking the powerful stone. And as they search, they learn of a plot to transmute the entire country for reasons they cannot comprehend.
          
          4. My Take on the Series: The Genre of the Series being Adventure, Dark fantasy and Steampunk. But in the later Half the series skewed towards being a shonen Genre Anime with plot primarily Focusing on the Protagonist's journey of obtaining the Philosopher's stone. The Setting of the Anime being similar to  mediaeval European or western society. The World building in the series is impeccable with every character leaving its own mark without getting neglected or overexposed. The Concept Seven deadly sins is well highlighted in the series with likes of Despicable "Envy" to Overwhelming homunculus "Dwarf in the Flask" not to mention seductive "lust" and annoying yet admirable"Gluttony". Military dictatorship is well defined with the State Alchemists (often ridiculed as Dogs of Military) and an Imposing Fuhrer "King Bradley" (AKA "Rage"). The OST of this series is Amazing with the opening track "Again" sung by J-pop Artist "YUI" being one of the best. The Action and Battle scenes are fast paced, immensely exciting with every fight scene being more incredible than the Last. Animation shifts continuously from being Gorgeous to deeply disturbing scene after scene. Colour grading is Exemplary with good mixing of light and dark shades. Not to mention this series boasts one of the most harrowing, horrifying and thought provoking scenes of Anime history which would definitely lead you to question your self and your penetrate deep into your psyche.(Episode 3: where the Shou tucker turns his own daughter into Chimera shows the blatant disregard of Humans towards their Relations) The authors  could work more on the immature humour of the series but nevertheless something is better than nothing. In the end if you're looking for something to make you jump off your seat. This Anime is made for you. It's also for those who disregard Anime as "content catered for kids"
